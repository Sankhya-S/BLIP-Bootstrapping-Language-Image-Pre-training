# BLIP-Bootstrapping-Language-Image-Pre-training

A presentation and implementation of the paper "BLIP: Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training for Unified Vision-Language Understanding and Generation" by Junnan Li, Dongxu Li, Caiming Xiong, Steven Hoi (Salesforce Research).

## Paper Overview

BLIP introduces a new vision-language pre-training framework that excels in both understanding and generation tasks. The paper addresses two major limitations in existing vision-language models:

1. Model Perspective: Previous models were either good at understanding tasks (like image-text retrieval) or generation tasks (like image captioning), but not both.

2. Data Perspective: Models relied heavily on noisy web-scraped data, which is suboptimal for learning.

## Key Innovations

1. **MED (Multimodal mixture of Encoder-Decoder)**
   - A unified architecture with three functionalities:
     - Unimodal encoder
     - Image-grounded text encoder
     - Image-grounded text decoder

2. **CapFilt (Captioning and Filtering)**
   ![CapFilt Process](images/figures/figure1.png)

   - Bootstraps training data through:
     - Caption generation for web images
     - Filtering of noisy captions

## Key Results

### Image-Text Retrieval
BLIP shows superior performance with minimal training data (14M images vs competitors' billions):

**On COCO Dataset:**
- Text-to-Image Retrieval: 80.6% accuracy (finding correct image for text)
- Image-to-Text Retrieval: 63.1% accuracy (finding correct text for image)
- Outperforms ALIGN (1.8B images) and SimVLM using 13Ã— less training data

### Image Captioning
Achieves state-of-the-art results in generating image descriptions:

**On NoCaps Dataset (CIDEr scores):**
- Overall: 105.1 (+4.7 over previous best)
- In-domain: 111.3 (familiar objects)
- Near-domain: 104.5 (similar objects)
- Out-domain: 102.4 (new objects)

### Visual Question Answering
Strong performance in understanding and answering image questions:
- 77.54% accuracy on VQA test
- 1.7% improvement over previous best (ALBEF)
- Achieved with simpler architecture and less training data

### Zero-shot Video Understanding
Successfully transfers to video tasks without video training:
- Text-to-Video Retrieval: 43.3% accuracy (surpassing video-specific models)
- Video QA Performance: MSRVTT-QA: 19.2%, MSVD-QA: 35.2%


## Discussion Questions for Deeper Understanding

1. **Nucleus Sampling vs Beam Search**
   
   Question: "Why does BLIP use nucleus sampling instead of beam search for generating synthetic captions, even though nucleus sampling has a higher noise ratio (25% vs 19%)?"
   
   - Nucleus sampling generates more diverse and surprising captions
   - Beam search tends to produce "safe" but common captions
   - More diverse captions provide richer training signals
   - Paper's ablation studies show better performance with nucleus sampling despite higher noise

2. **Parameter Sharing Strategy**
   
   Question: "BLIP's architecture shares all parameters between the encoder and decoder except for the self-attention layers. What motivated this specific design choice?"
   
   - Encoder requires bidirectional attention for understanding
   - Decoder needs causal attention for generation
   - Sharing other parameters improves efficiency (reduces model size)
   - Ablation studies show performance degradation when sharing all parameters
   - Balance between model efficiency and task-specific requirements

## Implementation Demo
