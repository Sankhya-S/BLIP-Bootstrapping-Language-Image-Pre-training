# BLIP-Bootstrapping-Language-Image-Pre-training

A presentation and implementation of the paper "BLIP: Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training for Unified Vision-Language Understanding and Generation" by Junnan Li, Dongxu Li, Caiming Xiong, Steven Hoi (Salesforce Research).

## Paper Overview

BLIP introduces a new vision-language pre-training framework that excels in both understanding and generation tasks. The paper addresses two major limitations in existing vision-language models:

1. Model Perspective: Previous models were either good at understanding tasks (like image-text retrieval) or generation tasks (like image captioning), but not both.

2. Data Perspective: Models relied heavily on noisy web-scraped data, which is suboptimal for learning.

### Key Innovations

1. **MED (Multimodal mixture of Encoder-Decoder)**
   - A unified architecture with three functionalities:
     - Unimodal encoder
     - Image-grounded text encoder
     - Image-grounded text decoder

2. **CapFilt (Captioning and Filtering)**
   ![CapFilt Process](images/figures/figure1.png)
   *Figure: CapFilt bootstrapping process*
   - Bootstraps training data through:
     - Caption generation for web images
     - Filtering of noisy captions


### Discussion Questions for Deeper Understanding

1. **Nucleus Sampling vs Beam Search**
   
   Question: "Why does BLIP use nucleus sampling instead of beam search for generating synthetic captions, even though nucleus sampling has a higher noise ratio (25% vs 19%)?"
   
   - Nucleus sampling generates more diverse and surprising captions
   - Beam search tends to produce "safe" but common captions
   - More diverse captions provide richer training signals
   - Paper's ablation studies show better performance with nucleus sampling despite higher noise

2. **Parameter Sharing Strategy**
   
   Question: "BLIP's architecture shares all parameters between the encoder and decoder except for the self-attention layers. What motivated this specific design choice?"
   
   - Encoder requires bidirectional attention for understanding
   - Decoder needs causal attention for generation
   - Sharing other parameters improves efficiency (reduces model size)
   - Ablation studies show performance degradation when sharing all parameters
   - Balance between model efficiency and task-specific requirements

- COCO Caption test set:
  - BLEU@4: 38.6
  - CIDEr: 129.7

### Visual Question Answering
- VQA test-dev: 77.54% (+1.7% over ALBEF)
- VQA test-std: 77.62%
- Achieved with simpler architecture and less pre-training data

### Video-Language Zero-shot Transfer
- Text-to-video retrieval on MSRVTT:
  - R@1: 43.3% (surpassing specially designed video models)
  - MdR: 2.0
